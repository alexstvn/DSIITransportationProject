# How to Use
## Inputting Data
To input data, I've mostly been updating the data using the Google Sheet that was shared with me and running it through a cleaning data script (which has yet to be finalized). 
Some notes:
- The cleaned data should get placed into `InputData`. 
- A sample file can be found in the Network drive by going into the DATA > COMPLAINT ANALYSIS directory.
## Running the program
Running Jupyter Notebooks may require some extra installation of programs, but if one has Python and/or Jupyter already downloaded, we can access it by:
1. Opening the `COMPLAINT ANALYSIS` folder by right clicking and selecting *Open in Terminal...*.
2. In the terminal, run the command `python -m jupyterlab`. The file should show up when navigating to the subfolder `JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS`.
3. Click *Run all cells*.
